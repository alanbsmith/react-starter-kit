# React Starter Kit
## Overview
This is a simple starter to get you up and running for React projects. This is intended to provide:

* a lightweight webpack config (for development and production)
* some helpful tooling for development workflow
* a similar setup to what you'll see in the wild
* Heroku-ready deployment setup

_* Note that this no longer works with github pages_

## Up & Running
• Install dependencies:

`npm install` or `yarn`

• Fire up a development server:

```js
npm run dev
```

Once the server is running, you can visit:

* `http://localhost:8080/` to run your application.


## Linting
To run the linter once:
```js
npm run lint
```

To run the watch task:
```js
npm run lint:watch
```

## Testing
To run the tests:
```
npm test
```

## Production Build
To build your production assets and run the server:
```js
npm start
```
